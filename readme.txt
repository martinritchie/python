Update 1, 23/05/2016: 

Added: configuration_model.py, global_clustering.py, network_validation.py and random_graph.py to the repoistory. My first pythong programs. Network validation checks a few basic metrics to ensure that the networks generated by either configuration_model.py or random_graph.py are not doing anything
unusual. 

Update 2, 09/06/2015. 

Added: gillespie.py, random_graph_fast.py and simulate_epidemic.
Updated: random_graph.py. 
This update was a lot slower than intended, it took me a while to find a debug methodolgy and a code profiler and then more time to learn how to use them. But now I am pretty confident with these essential tools. The code
profiler is especially helpful to develop intuition regarding what python does well, or otherwise.   
gillespie.py is the most significant addition. I wrote two vesions of gillespie.py, the first time using 
arrays and the second version (the git version) using lists. random_graph_fast.py will generates networks
without using for loops. There is a final update to come for epidemic related code, which will be in the form of ODEs to compare to simulation which should, hopefully, be strong evidence that everything is working correctly.
